Versioning
==========

The versioning scheme adopted here is the `Semantic Versioning 2`_.

The development process
-----------------------

Any code addition must come in the form of Pull Requests from forked
repositories. Any merged pull request is followed the by respective increment in
the software version.

Additions to the documentation *also* count to the version number.

Additions to the CI platform *may* be pushed directly to the master by the main
maintainer and should skip an increase in version number.
